//Add Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects
//A foods object has been created with three entries. Using the syntax of your choice, add three more entries to it: bananas with a value of 13, grapes with a value of 35, and strawberries with a value of 27.

let foods = {
    apples: 25,
    oranges: 32,
    plums: 28
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  foods['bananas'] = 13;
  foods['grapes'] = 35;
  foods['strawberries'] = 27;
  // Only change code above this line
  
  console.log(foods);


  //Modify an Object Nested Within an Object
//Here we've defined an object userActivity, which includes another object nested within it. Set the value of the online key to 45.

let userActivity = {
    id: 23894201352,
    date: 'January 1, 2017',
    data: {
      totalUsers: 51,
      online: 42
    }
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  userActivity.data.online = 45;
  // Only change code above this line
  
  console.log(userActivity);

//Access Property Names with Bracket Notation
//We've defined a function, checkInventory, which receives a scanned item as an argument. Return the current value of the scannedItem key in the foods object. You can assume that only valid keys will be provided as an argument to checkInventory.

  let foods = {
    apples: 25,
    oranges: 32,
    plums: 28,
    bananas: 13,
    grapes: 35,
    strawberries: 27
  };
  
  function checkInventory(scannedItem) {
    // Only change code below this line
    return foods[scannedItem];
    // Only change code above this line
  }
